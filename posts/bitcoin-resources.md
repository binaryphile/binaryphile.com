Like lots of folks, I've taken a much stronger interest in bitcoin as an
emerging technology of late, especially after the runup and crash after
November this year.  While there is a ton of volatility in bitcoin, I
can't help but be optimistic about its place in the future.  I've put
together this list of resources which I've found useful in getting to
know how to understand and use bitcoin.  Enjoy.

### Exchanges

Before trusting any Exchange with your funds, verify that you can
transact a small amount both into and out of their site.  Also do your
research on their reputations.  People _do_ lose money to some of them.
The fact that I'm listing any here is not an endorsement.  Caveat
emptor.

**Always** use 2-factor authentication with a generator such as
Google Authenticator or Yubikey.  SMS or email is not secure as a second
factor.
